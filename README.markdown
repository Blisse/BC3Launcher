<h2> BC3Launcher </h2>

Attempted to reproduce some of the features of Beyond Compare 3 [BC3]. However, I realized that
BC3 had much superior file comparison features, including speed and display, than I could make in 
my spare time.

Perhaps in the future, I will attempt to re-attempt the comparisons.

<h3> Final </h3>

The Final folder contains a couple scripts I made to run and parse BC3's Reports. They can
be run in single or batch format. I thought this was enough, but it turned out to be too difficult
to set up and run.

<h3> Trial </h3>

The Trial folder contains my attempt to copy BC3's features, then my attempt to copy BC3's reports
into my program, and some other tests. Not really that useful.

I decided to use wxPython, an extension of wxWindows, to create a proper user interface.

<h3> proto </h3>

proto.pyw is my launcher program for BC3. I should add a check for the installation of Beyond Compare 3,
namely the BCompare.exe file. It requires Python 2.7 to run properly. It is my finished product, which is
nice to look at, but I could make some improvements. 

Open the program, make sure two files are loaded and run Beyond Compare 3.

The main reason I made this program was the extra two text boxes at the bottom, which can find any duplicate
lines in the two text boxes and remove them. It is a specific requirement for some of the reports that
this program was used to run.
