to use this script, you will need
Python 2.7 (environment PATH should be set automatically)
Beyond Compare 3

there are two types of scripts you can run, batch or single

// SINGLE

to run the single pdf compare you need

BCresults.py
BCscript.txt
BCsinglecompare.bat

a example has been set up for you to walk through under 

EXAMPLES\SINGLE

open up BCsinglecompare.bat in notepad++
if it is your first time using this, make sure the exe points to your BCompare.exe
otherwise, set file1 and file2 to two pdfs in the same directory
if it is in a subfolder, include that path, such as ASANQA\file1.pdf
double click BCsinglecompare.bat
if it is your first time using this, it is advised to check Close When Finished in the Beyond Compare 3 reporting tool
	this will speed up the process a little bit
double click BCresults.py
open up the newly generated Report.txt



// BATCH

to run the batch pdf compare you need

BCresults.py
BCscript.txt
BCcompare.bat
BCbatchcompare.py
BCbatchrun.py

a example has been set up for you to walk through under 

EXAMPLES\BATCH

batch is easier, but you will need to setup the folders and files properly before you can run
this means you will have to edit a couple of strings in python
python spacing is very important. make sure you don't break it badly

separate your comparison files into two folders based on the server which you're comparing it to

inside both of the folders should be pdfs with the same name ( 001, 002, etc), hopefully corresponding to the folder name

inside BCbatchcompare.py and BCbatchrun.py, there will be folder1 and folder2 variables that name a folder
here, set the folder1 and folder2 to the two folders you put the files in

run BCbatchcompare.py
then run BCbatchrun.py

the reports for the pdf name should be under the Reports folder with the same name as the pdfs




// WHAT TO LOOK FOR

the Report files generates a list of all differences between the two reports, ignoring "order"

there are a few false negatives that you should check


these are date negatives

Tuesday, May 29, 2012 5:26:38 PM E. & O.E. Page 1 of 59

because each file runs at a different time and the pdfs include the timestamp, you get a lot of these


make sure the page numbers are equal. if they're unequal, you'll get things like

Line 778 - LEROUX BEVERLY Your Report for Jan 1, 2000 to Mar 14, 2005
Line 780 - 

where one line is blank, and not matching any other line


this is a multiple ownership false negative

Line 151 - Assante Account #92727704NO Nominee Open - Sandra Adelman & Francene Adelman & Others
Line 151 - Assante Account #92727704NO Nominee Open - Sandra Adelman & Lillian Adelman & Others

because there are 3 or more owners, only two of them are selected at random, so Lillian Adelman is actually the Others in the first line

// NOTES

use a very high level path without spaces
U:\user_name\BeyondCompare\Reports is good
U:\user_name\Beyond Compare\Reports will fail

only use the scripts from this folder.
i will not update the scripts in the folders unless the functionality changes
